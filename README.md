# YT-Channel-Analysis

In this project we analyze several Educational Youtube channels and present our findings using bar plots. We also do an in-depth analysis of one of the channels.

This project uses YouTube Data API to extract the information we want about the channels and then we use other libraries such as Pandas and Seaborn to wrangle the data and build Bar Charts using the data we gathered.
